# Global ignore patters. They cause the files with the following names and
# extensions to be ignored in general by Git.
#
# We ignore these files because they're usually binary and/or very large, which
# greatly bloats the repository and its clone time. In this category are the
# files .h5/.hdf5/.txt/.log and files named *log_file*. Some of these logs are
# enormous.
#
# We also ignore files that can be easily reproduced one way or another by
# compilers, like .pyc/.o/.so/.a/.lib.
#
# Lastly we ignore files and directories that signal their temporary character
# with a name that contains "tmp".
#
# ****************************************************************************
# ** DO NOT put ignore patterns here that are private to your clone of this **
# ** repository. Those belong in your clone's .git/info/exclude file.       **
